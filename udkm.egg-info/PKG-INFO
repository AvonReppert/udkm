# udkm
a collection of python commands for data analysis in udkm group

## tools
general functions and definitions for data analysis, which includes:
- ```helpers```: general data analysis routines
- ```colors``` : frequently used colors and colormaps
- ```constants```: frequently used constants
- ```testing```: a sandbox file for testing git

## moke
library for the MOKE setup in the femto-magnetism lab, which includes:
- ```functions```: data analysis functions

## pxs
library for the X-ray diffraction setup using the Plasma X-ray source
- ```functions```: data analysis functions

# installation of the code

## option 1: download the code repository via git:
This allows you to have editable source file that you can add to the pyhton search path. 

1. install git that is available from ```https://git-scm.com/downloads```
2. run git and initialize your name and e-mail adress via:
  ``` 
  git config --global user.name "John Doe"
  git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
  ```
3. go to folder where you want to store the code repository for example ```C:\Users\Aleks\Documents\Code``` 
4. open a console by typing  ```cmd``` into your explorer line
5. clone the repsoitory via ```git clone https://github.com/AleksUDKM/udkm.git```
6. add the repository to your search path of your python distribution 
   in Spyder I have ```C:\Users\Aleks\Documents\Code\udkm``` in the PYTHONPATH manager  
7. Klick the synchronize button and restart Spyder to be sure that the changes are applied

To see if your installation works try:
```
import udkm.tools.helpers as helpers
print(helpers.teststring)
```
which should yield: "Successfully loaded udkm.tools.helpers"


## option 2: via pip using git:
Allows usage of the code without the option of changing it

```pip install git+https://github.com/AleksUDKM/udkm.git ```

# contributing to the repository:

To contribute code to the repository you need a GitHub account. 
Once you have that let me know and then I will add you as contributor. 
For testing purposes I recommend modifications of the "udkm/tools/testing" file

1. open a command window in the directory of the repository (for example: ```C:\Users\Aleks\Documents\Code\udkm``` )
2. check that you have no conflicts by typing ``` git status``` 
3. get the most recent version of the repository via ``` git pull ```
4. modify the code on your local machine and test that it works. 
5. once you are satisfied you can add your changes to the repository by  ```git add * ```
6. commit your changes via ```git commit -m  "short description of the commit" ```
7. push your commits into the online repository via ```git push``` 

# usage of the matplotlib style file

In udkm.tools you find the file ```udkm_base.mplstyle``` that we use as a default in matplotlib.
To add it to the preinstalled matplotlib styles follow these steps:

1. Look for the function path of matplotlib using
```
import matplolitb
matplotlib.matplotlib_fname()
```
2. There you will find a folder called ```stylelib``` to which you copy the file ```udkm_base.mplstyle``` 
3. After restarting your kernel you should be able to use the new plotstyle via:
```
import matplolitb.pyplot as plt
plt.style.use("udkm_base")
``` 
Alternatively you can import the plotstyle file into your runtime using the absolute or relative path
to the style file via ```plt.style.use(path_to_file+"/udkm_base.mplstyle")```, potentially also in the startup routine.
